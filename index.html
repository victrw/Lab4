                <p>My name is <b>Victor</b>, and I was born and raised in Vancouver. Growing up, I've always been around the computer, so I grew quite fond of technology. Because I was around tech at a young age, I've developed a love for gaming <strong>especially</strong> for FPS and MMORPGs.</p>

                 <p>To keep up with the hardware demands of some games, I started to build my own computers as it was far <em><strong>better</strong></em> and <em><strong>cheaper</strong></em> than pre-builts at the same price point.</p>
