        <h1>Who am I</h1>
            <p>My name is <b>Victor</b>, and I was born and raised in Vancouver. Growing up, I&#39;ve always been around the computer, so I grew quite fond of technology.<br>
                 Because I was around tech at a young age, I&#39;ve developed a love for gaming <strong>especially</strong> for FPS and MMORPGs. To keep up with the hardware <br>
                 demands of some games, I started to build my own computers as it was far <em><strong>better</strong></em> and <em><strong>cheaper</strong></em> than prebuilts at the same price point.</p>
